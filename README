This is intended to server as an example of a type specification to manage creates of Puppet nodes.

This is currently in development state, do not expect anything to work. Nothing is sufficiently tested, I promise ;)

Also, this README is not up to date, please read the actual type code for this.

This module will hold types and providers related to managing node provisioning.

The basic idea is as follows:

  - node 
    - node type
      - name (is this hostname)
      - do we have any control over MAC/ipaddres?
      - memory - amount of memory provisioned
      - disksize
      - ncpus - number of CPUS
      - owner - machines have owners
      - group - information that determines how machine should be parameterized.
      - role - list of classes that define a machines role.
    - linode provider
    - EC2 provider
    - rackspace cloud provider
  - manifests - it doesnt make sense to have any manifests. The providers may need manifests to initialize connections of something (install required APIs and whatnot)
